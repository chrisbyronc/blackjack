# PHP Auto blackjack player

As a challenge to learn PHP, this is a automated blackjack game. This features a computer playing against a user (you).
For the player to win, they must play through the entirety of the game without going in the hole. To give the player an 
advantage, they were given the ability to count cards. As this may give the player some advantage, it still does not leave the odds in their favor.
